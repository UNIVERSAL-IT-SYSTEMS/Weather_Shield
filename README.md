*Weather Shield (DEV-12081)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12081)

Weather Shield is an Arduino shield that gathers relative humidity, barometric pressure, temperature, light intensity, as well as optional rain, wind direction, and wind speed (using optional [external weather gauges](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942)).

Weather Shield is an open source hardware project.

**NOTE**: You will need to install additional libraries to work with the example sketch for this board. Please check the [MPL3115A2 Breakout Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/MPL3115A2_Breakout) and the [HTU21D Breakout Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/HTU21D_Breakout) for the required libraries.
